# Password Generator Project

This is a simple Password Generator project built using React, making use of `useState`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` hooks along with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Project Overview

The Password Generator allows you to generate strong and secure passwords with ease. By default, it sets the password length to 8 characters. Key features of this project include:

- A slider to determine the length of the generated password.
- Checkbox options to include numbers and special characters in the generated password.
- Real-time updates: The changes in password length, numbers, and character preferences take effect without the need to refresh the page.

## Learning Objectives

This project aims to help you grasp the following concepts:

1. Running a process as soon as the page loads, ensuring that the password generator is ready for use upon opening the application.
2. Handling dependencies efficiently:
   - Modifying the password length via the slider.
   - Enabling or disabling numbers and special characters.
   All of these actions trigger the password generation process.
3. Running processes and managing dependencies in an optimized manner to create a responsive and user-friendly experience.
4. Targeting a specific field: The 'Copy' button allows you to copy the generated password to your clipboard, ensuring convenience and security for your online accounts.
