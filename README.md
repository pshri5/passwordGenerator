# Password Generator
This project consists of a password generator where the default length is set to 8. The project features  include,

- A slide to determine the length of the string generated
- A checkbox to include numbers and characters in the string generated
- All the above changes are occurring without the page refreshing

# Learning objectives
1. Running a process as soon as the page loads
2. Handling dependencies like the length slider, number and character check boxes because as soon as there is some changes in these the process has to run again
3. Running process and handling the dependencies in an optimized way.
4. Targeting a particular field, which can be seen in the copy button which when clicked copies the text on a specific field which is where the password has been generated.
